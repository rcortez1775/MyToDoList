# My To Do List

## Technologies

My To Do List utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## How Does it work?

When a user places text inside the input box and presses enter or the 'Add' button, The value of the input is taken and Appended to an element that is created in the list. An Event Listener is added to the list items so that when a user clicks on them, CSS is used to change the font-decoration and color to alert the user the task has been completed.

If a user creates a list and presses the 'Save' button, the list is stored in the users local storage so that the page may be refreshed and still hold the users data.

If a user presses the 'Clear' button, the list items are deleted from local storage.
